## 📚 Part 1: Intro to Scrum (30 mins)

### 🔹 What is Scrum?

Scrum is an Agile framework for managing projects by breaking work into **sprints**.

| Element       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Roles**     | Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team |
| **Artefacts** | Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment |
| **Events**    | Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Review, Retrospective |
| **Sprint**    | A 1–4 week period to deliver a working increment |

### 🧩 Group Activity:

As a class, discuss how to plan a “Welcome Week” event using Scrum. Break this into a backlog of activities.

## 🧪 Part 2: GitHub Projects Lab (90 mins)

### 🚧 Scenario:

“You are part of the **Student Dev Club** tasked with planning a ‘Welcome Week’ orientation event. Use GitHub Projects to organise this plan using Scrum principles.”

### 🛠️ Instructions

#### ✅ Step 1: Create a GitHub Project
1. Go to your GitHub account.
2. Click your profile → **Projects** → **New Project**.
3. Choose **Table** or **Board** view.
4. Name it: `Welcome Week Sprint Plan`.

#### 🧾 Step 2: Add Columns (Board View)
- Backlog
- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

#### 👥 Step 3: Assign Scrum Roles
- **Product Owner** – prioritises work
- **Scrum Master** – facilitates planning
- **Team Members** – carry out tasks

#### 🧠 Step 4: Write User Stories
Format:
> As a _[user]_, I want to _[action]_ so that _[benefit]_.

Create 6–10 user stories and add them to **Backlog**.

#### 🏷️ Step 5: Create GitHub Issues
1. Convert each story into an issue.
2. Assign team members.
3. Add labels and set priorities.

#### 🗂️ Step 6: Plan the Sprint
Move selected issues to **To Do** – this becomes your Sprint Backlog.

#### 🔁 Step 7: Sprint Simulation
- Run a **Daily Scrum**: What was done? What’s next? Any blockers?
- Move tasks between columns to simulate progress.

#### 🧾 Step 8: Retrospective
Discuss:
- What worked well?
- What could improve?
- What did we learn?
