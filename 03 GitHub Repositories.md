# 🧪 Lab: GitHub Repositories & GitHub Desktop – Version Control in Action

## 🕐 Duration: 60 minutes  
🎯 **Objective**: To help students understand GitHub repositories and version control concepts, install GitHub Desktop, and learn how to work with branches effectively.

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

- Define a GitHub repository and understand its structure
- Install and set up GitHub Desktop on their machine
- Clone repositories locally and push changes to GitHub
- Create and switch between branches
- Understand how to use branches for collaboration and experimentation

## 💻 Step 1: Download & Install GitHub Desktop (10 mins)

1. Go to [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Click **Download for your OS** (Windows/macOS)
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts
4. Log in with your GitHub account when prompted

📌 _GitHub Desktop is a GUI tool that simplifies Git operations locally and syncs with GitHub.com._

---

## 🗃️ Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository (15 mins)

1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Name your repository (e.g., `github-lab-username`)
3. Add a description (e.g., “First test repo for version control lab”)
4. Choose **Public**
5. ✅ Tick “Add a README file”
6. Click **Create repository**

📦 _This is now your remote repository – the central hub where changes will be tracked._

---

## 🧲 Step 3: Clone the Repository to Your Computer (5 mins)

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Go to **File → Clone Repository**
3. Select your newly created repo from the list
4. Choose a local folder where the repository will be stored
5. Click **Clone**

🔁 _You now have a local copy of your GitHub repo on your device!_

---

## 🌿 Step 4: Understand and Work with Branches (20 mins)

### 🔀 What is a Branch?
A **branch** is a copy of your code where you can make changes independently before merging it back.

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Feature development (`feature/homepage`)
- Bug fixes (`fix/header-overlap`)
- Experimentation (`test/alt-layout`)

### 🔧 Create and Switch Branches

1. In GitHub Desktop, click on the current branch name (default: `main`)
2. Click **New Branch**
3. Name your branch (e.g., `feature-bio-update`)
4. Click **Create Branch**

Now you’re working in an isolated copy.

### ✍️ Make and Commit Changes

1. Edit the `README.md` or any file locally
2. Go back to GitHub Desktop – changes will be visible in the sidebar
3. Add a summary and description of your change
4. Click **Commit to [branch name]**

### 🔼 Push to GitHub

Click **Push origin** to upload your branch changes to GitHub.com.

## 🧪 Step 5: Practical Activity – Team Workflow Simulation (15 mins)

### Scenario:  
Grab your friend. Add one another as contributors to your repos. Each student will create a branch and add a line to the README file with their name and a fun fact.

1. Create a branch named `update-yourname`
2. Open the README file in your code editor or Notepad
3. Add: `- [Your Name]: [Fun Fact]`
4. Commit the change in GitHub Desktop
5. Push your branch to GitHub
6. Open your repository on GitHub.com and **Compare & pull request**

🧠 _If time allows, review a peer’s pull request and leave a comment._
